00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.400
A lonely road, crossed another
cold state line

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.700
Miles away from those I love
purpose undefined

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.000
While I recall all the words
you spoke to me

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.600
Can't help but wish that I was there

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.100
And where I'd love to be, oh yeah

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.000
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.800
To hold her when I'm not around

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.500
When I'm much too far away

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.500
We all need that person who
can be true to you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.000
But I left her when I found her

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.200
And now I wish I'd stayed

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.800
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.800
I'm missing you again oh no

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.600
Once again

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.500
There's nothing here for me on
this barren road

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.600
There's no one here while the
city sleeps

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.000
And all the shops are closed

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.300
Can't help but think of the
times I've had with you

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.000
Pictures and some memories
will have to help me through,
oh yeah

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.200
Dear God the only thing I ask
of you is to hold her when I'm
not around

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.700
When I'm much too far away

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.600
We all need that person who
can be true to you

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.100
I left her when I found her

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.200
And now I wish I'd stayed

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.600
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.200
I'm missing you again oh no

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.100
Once again

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.900
Some search, never finding a way

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.600
Before long, they waste away

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.800
I found you, something told me to stay

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.500
I gave in, to selfish ways

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.800
And how I miss someone to hold

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.900
When hope begins to fade

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.300
A lonely road, crossed another
cold state line

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:31.100
Miles away from those I love
purpose undefined

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:39.300
Dear God the only thing I ask
of you is to hold her when I'm
not around

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.800
When I'm much too far away

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.800
We all need the person who can
be true to you

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.200
I left her when I found her

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.400
And now I wish I'd stayed

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.800
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.100
I'm missing you again oh no

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.300
Once again

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:22.300
